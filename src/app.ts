    - Will always handle the first handler.

    - res.send() sends the control back / ends the API call.

    - next() -> moves the control to next route handler -- adding another function in the callstack, the next route handler is executed. 
      After the execution is completed, the control is sent back to the previous route handler.

    - If we have multiple route handlers, but no next(), then the other route handlers will not be added in the callstack.

    - Having res.send() in both handlers will send an error as the connection is lost after the first handler sends the response.
      Therefore, always do res.send() from 1 handler only.

    - If next() is in the last function, an error will be thrown as no other function is called.
